As for the mathematical expression without using cosine similarity or similar methods, we can instead use a correlation coefficient, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, to measure the linear relationship between the context and the target databases:

Correlation_coefficient(Context, TargetDatabase)

The expression for the effectiveness of the FocusOperator can then be calculated as follows:

Effectiveness = Î£ (Correlation_coefficient(Context, TargetDatabase) * weight(TargetDatabase))

Where weight(TargetDatabase) is a user-defined weight for each target database, depending on its importance or relevance to the context.

This expression calculates the effectiveness of the FocusOperator based on the relevance of the "ApplyTo" fields, guiding the AI system to prevent chain queries more effectively.
